            <p>The Windsor based brand agency 1HQ ran a competition to create the design for a pale ale. They have an inhouse bar and were going to be stocking their ‘own brand’ beer. The design was to be influenced by both Windsor and their company. For this project, I was working with Josh Eyles. 
            <br><br>
            Wanting to avoid cliché references to Windsor such as castles and crowns, we looked for something less well known. During our research we discovered the old English name for the town was ‘Windles-ore’ meaning ‘winch by the riverside’. We took this for the beer’s name, focusing on ‘Ore’. We loved the tone of it, it sounded perfect for an ale. It also brings with it the idea of a raw material, something that requires craft and effort to become something else. This links to the creative process – an idea is forged into a finished design. </p>

            <div class="p-txt" id="p-t-2">
            <p>For the design style we focused on ore veins, the elements use slivers of white against a black background. The elements depicted relate to the history of Windsor’s name. The shape of the bottle’s label was designed to be transferable to other uses such as beer mats and pump clips.

            As a result of this project, both of us were awarded work placements at 1HQ.</p>
