            <p>In November of each year, there is a UCAS event called Design Your Future.  Universities from all over the UK gather and set up stalls in London and Manchester to promote their Arts and Design courses.  Our brief was to design the stall for our University. Working in a team of three, we put forward our idea for the stall, which was chosen to be used.

        <div class="product-img" id="a-i-2"></div>
        <div class="product-text" id="a-t-2">
            <p>The stall needed to grab attention and be memorable in a crowded venue – to do this our idea was to have it styled as a bright yellow lemonade stand, a simple and bold idea. The yellow was there to be eye-catching, and looking down the aisles between the stands, it worked. You could see the yellow popping out from between the crowd. We used the lemonade stand as a fun idea that twists an existing situation that has some similarities to it’s new use. Lemon-themed goody bags were handed out containing lemon sherberts and the information about the university and its courses.

        <div class="product-text" id="a-t-3">
            <p>We created the brand  ‘Fresh { UoG }’ to use throughout. The curly brackets hinted at a lemon, but also acted as a device where we could switch out the text depending on the context. </p>
