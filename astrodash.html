            <p> In 1996, my grandad invented a board game for my older brother and sister to play (I was 3 at the time). He named it ‘Astrodash’, even creating a hand drawn logo for it. Two different star-maps created the playing board, and a 20+ page handwritten booklet formed the rules. 
            <br><br>
            My family recently rediscovered the original, handmade game (pictured above). I was amazed, I’ve been working in a company that creates games for nearly three years and am fascinated by space. I decided that I wanted to recreate and redesign Astrodash to produce a new version that built upon the amazing effort my grandad had put into the original and combined it with my skills and knowledge as a designer in the games industry.</p>

            <div class="p-txt" id="p-t-2">
            <p> I went about recrafting the logo first to create the initial visual identity that would help decide how the rest of the game would look while I got to grips with the gameplay. The redesigned logo takes the styling of the ‘A’ from the original, while updating the overall design to have more of a classic sci-fi feel. I wanted a dynamic feel to the design, much like many space agency logos have. The extended crossbar of the A creates a swoosh that hints at a shooting star or rocket trail and compliments the rest of the angled type to make it feel like the whole thing is shooting through space.</p>

            <p> A visual overview of the board setup. the redesign uses a dark blue as the main background to allow the important details for gameplay to stand out and feels much more like the night sky. The sky maps were created accurately (including the decorative stars) by using ‘Cartes du Ciel’, a map projection application, to produce the two different projections. It’s important to me that this game is as accurate as possible, by playing this game you should be able to get a better understanding of the constellations and how to spot them in the night sky.

            <p> I came across a few technical challenges when redesigning the components, primarily the wipeout zone triangle. The triangle needs to be able to slide across the board without having to move all the pieces. The original solved this by resting on the edge of card, so that only a thin edge had to touch the board and the rest was raised above. I tried a few approaches of creating something similar, that could potentially be produced for a commercial game. However, as I thought through all the components I realised to create something commercially viable would mean stripping the game back too much so I decided that first of all I would create a premium, ‘limited edition’ version for me and my family. 
            <br><br>    
            This made it possible to create the best solution for the wipeout triangles – a multi-layered board that allows the triangle to slide underneath the pieces. The top layer is clear acrylic, and the middle layer cut along the ecliptic to allow the wipeout triangle to slide through the gap while the game pieces sit on top of the acrylic.</p>

            <p> This is a project I’m currently still working on, I’ve still got to source the game pieces, create a printed rulebook and a box to contain it all. I’m looking into the viability of 3D printed pieces, which would be ideal as it would allow me to create something unique and in fitting with the rest of the design. There’s also an ‘expansion pack’ that my granddad created which adds in new gameplay involving the moon which I’ll be bringing to this version of Astrodash in the future.</p>
