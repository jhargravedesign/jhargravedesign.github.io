            <p>Which One? is a trivia game with some big differences. Match up to five answers with five questions correctly to win points; which one goes with which? 
            <br>Sounds simple, but there’s a twist! If any of your answers are incorrect, you lose all your points for the round! Will you gamble on an answer or play it safe?
            <br>Not only can you play against opponents, but the randomised points cards mean you can also play as a single player against “The Game!” Which One? is a great family game with a huge variety of topics across 300 cards. How much do you know about British Sitcoms, French cities, Mr Men books or Rugby League teams? You may know enough to be sure about three answers, but are you prepared to gamble on answers four and five?”

            <p>Which One? is a game produced by Ginger Fox. I created the packaging and content design as a junior designer in the Cheltenham based company.
            <br><br>
            I wanted to focus on the indecision the multiple-choice trivia presents for the design. Through our gametests it become obvious that the element of risk from just a single incorrect answer made you go back and forth on every uncertain answer. I hoped to portray this using inter-twining, twisting arrows as the main focus for the design.
